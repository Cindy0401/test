# Finishing Up

1. Systematically evaluate and close all issues, preferably as a team.
2. Remove all commented out code, after discussion, and resolve all FIXME's.
3. Confirm that the source code is fully annotated with Javadocs comments.
4. Merge & close all branches, significant new features should be avoided now.
5. Begin completing the final report and test report.


## Introduction

"..."

## Final Requirements

"Discuss the changes in the document, add the requirements themselves as an appendix."

## Summary

"..."

## Teamwork

"An evaluation of how well the team worked together must be provided. Quantification of the relative input of each individual team member
for each of the components of the product shown as a percentage of involvement." This should be agreed as a team.

## Individual Contributions

One side A4 with "their own reflections on the team and on their own contribution". To be included in the final report.

## Compulsory Appendix

"Coding Standards adopted by the team."

* Camel case should be used for all variable and function names.
* Constants should be capitalised, with underscores for spaces.
* Curly braces should not be placed on their own line.
* Arithmetic operators have spaces between for readability.
* Imports are separated with a space for distinct domains and are sort strict alphabetically in each block.
* Getters and Setters are named as such and are used with private variables to avoid breaking encapsulation.
* TODO: Formalise more implicit coding standards.
